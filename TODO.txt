- Crosscheck syntax (for instance: references, if(exp) should only accept bool as exp, function params)
- Unit tests
- Line annotation in C code
- Automatic type deduction
- Write README (including short info about lang syntax)
- Look over array implementation
- Collections API:s
- Consider user defined member functions (or stick with first method function params)
- Printf, string.format os something similar
- Make sure internal functions are prefixed by _ so that they are not callable from varan-code
- Have all code generated in CodeGenerator.hs (none in Compiler.hs)
- Functions in local file should be callable in any order (declaration order should not matter)
- Tests for garbage collection
- Register user defined types with garbage collector
- Don't copy already copied objects in garbage collector (for instance objects with multiple references)
