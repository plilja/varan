- Remove semicolon at end of for loop and if/ifelse-statements
- Add "continue" statement

- Unit tests
- "Pass by value" vs "pass by reference" for function calls
- Assignment user defined types
- Line annotation in C code
- Include files
- Automatic type deduction
- Write README (including short info about lang syntax)
- Look over array implementation
- Collections API:s
- Consider user defined member functions (or stick with first method function params)
