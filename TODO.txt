- Add "continue" statement
- Crosscheck syntax (for instance: references, if(exp) should only accept bool as exp, function params)
- Unit tests
- "Pass by value" vs "pass by reference" for function calls
- Line annotation in C code
- Include files
- Automatic type deduction
- Write README (including short info about lang syntax)
- Look over array implementation
- Collections API:s
- Consider user defined member functions (or stick with first method function params)
- Separate header files from impl files
- Ability to specify which output file compiler should write to
- Compile files in appropriate order so compile env can propagate between files
