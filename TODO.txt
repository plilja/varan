- Crosscheck syntax (for instance: references, if(exp) should only accept bool as exp, function params)
- Unit tests
- Line annotation in C code
- Automatic type deduction
- Write README (including short info about lang syntax)
- Look over array implementation
- Collections API:s
- Consider user defined member functions (or stick with first method function params)
- Separate header files from impl files
- Printf, string.format os something similar
